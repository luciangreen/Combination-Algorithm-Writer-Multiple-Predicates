# Combination Algorithm Writer with Multiple Predicates

Combination Algorithm Writer with Multiple Predicates is a SWI-Prolog algorithm that finds algorithms from given rules,  algorithm parts (from algdict.pl) and writes algorithms with multiple predicates that satisfy the given input and output.

# Getting Started

Please read the following instructions on how to install the project on your computer for writing code.

# Prerequisites

Install List Prolog Interpreter Repository (https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter) first.

# Installing

* Download this repository.
* In SWI-Prolog, enter:
```
['cawplistprolog'].
```
* Running

Try CAWP regression tests (in <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Combination-Algorithm-Writer-Multiple-Predicates/blob/master/cawpverify.pl">cawpverify.pl</a>):
Example
`cawptest(off,N,S).`
Example Output
```
[cawptest,1,passed]

[cawptest,2,passed]

[cawptest,3,passed]

[cawptest,4,passed]

N = S, S = 2.
```
